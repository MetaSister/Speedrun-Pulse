# Speedrun Pulse
• Speedrun Pulse is an minimal desktop application, allowing you to closely follow world records (WR) and leaderboards in your favorite games. It integrates with the Speedrun.com database to ensure you get the most up-to-date information instantly and never miss a record.

• Overview
------------
• The world of speedrunning is constantly in motion, and records can change hands in a matter of seconds. Speedrun Pulse offers a centralized solution for players, viewers, and content creators who want to stay informed in this dynamic environment. You no longer need to manually check dozens of different games and categories; you can manage all the speedruns you care about from a single place and receive instant notifications when new records are broken.

• Game Search and Discovery
------------------------------
• Easily search among thousands of games on Speedrun.com.

• Find the right game easily by distinguishing them by their release year.

• Detailed Category and Level Tracking
----------------------------------------
• Track not only the full game but also individual levels (ILs).

• Add specific runs to your tracking list by specifying sub-categories (e.g., "120 Star" or "Any%") and variables (e.g., character or platform choice).

• Automatic World Record Tracking and Notifications
-----------------------------------------------------
• The application automatically checks all the categories you follow at set intervals.

• When a new world record is broken in a category you're tracking, the app visually alerts you with a "New WR!" tag on the main screen.

• With the "Recently Broken Records" window, you can see all the new records that were broken in the past and that you might have missed.

• Advanced Leaderboards
--------------------------
• View the full leaderboard (up to the top 200) for any category you follow.

• Easily review runners' ranks, times, and the dates they achieved their records.

• Go to the relevant run's Speedrun.com page or the record-holder's profile with a single click.

• Customization and Ease of Use
---------------------------------
• Multi-Language Support: Use the application in Turkish, English, German, Spanish, and many other languages.

• Customizable Theme: Thanks to the Theme.json file, you can fully customize the application's colors and fonts to your liking.

• Sorting Options: Organize your tracked runs by sorting them by date added or game name.

• Local and Secure Data Storage
-------------------------------
• All the runs you track are stored securely on your computer locally in the Tracked Runs.json file. None of your data is shared externally.

• Technical Structure
----------------------
• Speedrun Pulse was developed using the Python programming language and the PyQt5 library for a modern interface. It communicates with the official Speedrun.com API to provide live and accurate data.
